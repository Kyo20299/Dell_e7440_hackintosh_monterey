Welcome to visit my first repo upload on github.

Note that I did not replace the Wi-fi card to a broadcom one and still using the original intel ac wifi card.
Annnnd, this is the end of my first post, if you got any question feel free to leave a comment and whatever request a issue or what, im still new to github so please be gentel if i made any mistake.
